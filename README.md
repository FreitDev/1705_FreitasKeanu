v0rtx

User App Definition:

An app that delivers the most accurate and efficient way to view specified deals that are happening in the area of the user.

-What is your app? Give a simple description: no more than a hundred words.

The user has the option to select tags (categories/sub-categories) to specify the data points that they are interested in. Having a distance proximity will give the user updates on the deals or promotions that the data points are offering. For instance, if a user was looking for a bar that is offering happy hour they will select that data point and when the user is within distance the application will notify you.

-Who is it for? Summarize the personas.

The application v0rtx is for student, young adults, and business’s. It can be for anyone that is looking to save money, but I am targeting the younger audience.

-Why do they want or need it? Explain how it benefits them.

This application can save people money and allow them to do so in a fun way. Recommendation’s also make people’s lives easier and saves them time from having to do research. This app will look for places in their proximity offering two ways to view the data points.

-What does it do? List the main (most important) features and why they’re important.

V0rtx is a proximity alert application that notifies the user about data points depending on their ware bouts.

-What doesn’t it do? List any features you’ve deliberately decided to exclude and why.

The application will not give the user coupons or points to accumulate in order to save money. This is not the business model. I want to keep the business happening directly from the business’s and the user. No middle wall.
